  ## Description
 
  A Chainlink Hackathon 2022 project. We decided to explore the idea of using a smart contract to facilitate an exchange of funds for data. The project combines both web3 and web2 technologies in order to accomplish this goal. The project can be explained as follows: 
 
  1. A company creates a survey. 
  2. A company adds funds to the smart contract. 
  3. A user takes the survey. 
  4. Chainlink Automation is brought in to check the state of the survey. 5. When the survey is deemed completed, the contract distributes the funds to the users.

  ## Getting Started

  In order for the application to function properly, you will need to have a MySQL database setup local and have a .env file with the varables...
  
  DB_USER=
  DB_PW=
  DB_NAME=
  
  along with your MySQL credentials. If you'd like to test out the web3 functionality, you will need to also clone the sibling repo to this project [Surpay-backend](https://github.com/guitarkeegan/surpay-backend)

  ## Usage

  > The contract would allow companies to offer a paid insentive for users to take a survey.
